    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>
        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the idea that the brain's capacity for learning is
        not "fixed" from any age, contrary to popular belief. The brain is in
        fact "plastic" at all stages of life, meaning that it is always possible
        to form new neural pathways, and thereby learn new skills, as well as
        override even deeply-ingrained habits. Studies have shown that the
        perception someone has about their own ability to change has a direct
        impact on the person's actual ability to - a group of students that have
        been taught about the brain's plasticity will typically perform better
        than a group who have not been taught this (and therefore likely believe
        that the brain is "fixed").

      <h2>
        Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
        your benefit.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Outside of Dev Acadmeny, I have learned a bit about self-hypnosis which
        is a great example of harnessing the brain's ability to rewire itself,
        and it is a valuable tool for rewriting limiting beliefs. This could be
        helpful in bootcamp when I might come across a block and need to get
        beyond messages of "I can't do this" or "it can't be done" etc.

        end of each sprint/week.

      <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Sustained focused intention - telling your brain that this is
          something important.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exercise/movement. Yoga - being almost off balance puts your brain
          into a heightened learning state
        </li>
        <li>Newness - novel experience</li>
        <li>Fasting</li>
        <li>Sleep! - this is when most of the remodelling-itself occurs</li>
        <li>Meditation - self-directed neuroplasticity</li>

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p>
        "Growth mindset" is the opposite of "fixed mindset", and is about
        believing in and working with the brain's ability to rewire itself (its
        neuroplasticity). It can be a powerful tool for learning new skills and
        concepts, and can be used to overcome limiting beliefs, such as the idea
        that the older you get, the harder it is to learn new things.
      </p>

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
      <p>
        No, but it was helpful to be reminded of these ideas and how important
        they are for learning.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
      <p>
        I will challenge myself to go into every Sprint with a "growth mindset",
        i.e. an attitude of patience and willingness to not need to know
        everything all at once or get it perfect, and with the idea that mastery
        is possible for anyone with enough time and practice.

        Confidence comes from "starting small, proving your ability to yourself

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>
        Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
        learning plan and strategy.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Other than what I've already said in my previous answers, to me these
        ideas serve as helpful reminders. I've already noticed that being at my
        learning edge each day has made the idea of doing other new and
        challenging things in my life outside of Dev Academy seem more possible,
        and I intend to keep striving ahead with a growth mindset and apply an
        attitude of "not yet" to any blocks I may face.
