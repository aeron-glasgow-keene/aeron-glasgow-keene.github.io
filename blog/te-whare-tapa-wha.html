    <h1>Te Whare Tapa Wha - My Health Plan while at Dev Academy</h1>

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
        I will go on a walk first thing every morning and do at least 10 mins of
        yoga every day.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>Taha WhƒÅnau (Family/Social Wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
        I will keep in touch with friends and family, and go on at least one
        social outing per week when possible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
        I will meditate for at least 5 mins a day (before coffee! No coffee
        without meditating!). Journalling every night and attending my Men's
        Group every fortnight.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
        I will do at least 2 hours of music production and at least 10 minutes
        of gratitude journalling per week.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h2>
      <p>
        Other than my daily morning walk, I will prioritise being out in the
        sunshine (on those rare Wellington winter days when there is any) for at
        least an hour - either walking somehwere or working on course stuff on
        the grass/outdoor furniture in the yard.
