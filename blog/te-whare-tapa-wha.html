      <p>
        I will: go to the gym 3 times a week (unless unwell or injured); do yoga at least twice a week; eat healthy and go to bed before 11pm every weeknight.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>Taha Whānau (Family/Social Wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
        I will keep in touch with friends and family, and go on at least one
        social outing per week when possible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
        I will meditate for at least 5 mins a day at least 5 times a week. I will continue journalling every night and attending my Men's
        Group every fortnight. I will go to campus for the day at least 90% of the time during the week. I will adhere to the same weekly schedule as much as possible. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
        I will do at least 1 hour of music production and at least 10 minutes
        of gratitude journalling per week.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h2>
      <p>
        I will stay mindful of the natural world during my walk to and from campus every day. I will go outside on my breaks when there is 
        sunshine (on those rare Wellington winter days when there is any) for at
        least 20 mins.
