    <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>Long term goals and career pathway:</h2>
      <p>
        To be a musician, digital nomad and activist, based in Europe. The
        skills at Dev Academy will serve me in finding work to sustain me at
        least financially while I work towards these goals. The impact I want to
        have on the world is something along the lines of: working with a team
        of people to fight the good fight in the developing renewable energy
        industry, helping other people to realise their own goals, and to be
        wherever I am needed to help make the world a more connected and
        sustainable place.

      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <p>
        My biggest limitations: perfectionism, pesky negative thoughts/beliefs,
        and my tendency to lose focus and motivation on the days when I feel
        "off". This is something that hasn't changed much so far through
        foundations, but it is something I have become more aware of as I've
        been continually confronted with it during the Sprint exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest strengths: my self-awareness, attention to detail, tenacity
        and honesty with myself, and occasionally remembering it's a ok to be a
        bit of a silly sausage sometimes.

      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Other than what I already mentioned in my answer to the last question:
        group speaking, asking for help, and saying no to social opportunities
        that I don't realistically have time for during bootcamp.

      <p>
        Group speaking, particularly off-the-cuff. Letting go of perfectionism.
        Taking initiative. Generating my own motivation and focus. Knowing my
        limits and setting boundaries.

    <div class="paragraph-box">

        direction rather than giving the right answers.

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h2>
      <p>
        That I will ask for help when I need it, using the Discord server to
        reach out to either my team or the facilitators. I will practice my best
        Non-Violent Communication when working with others and providing
        feedback, and be honest with how I'm doing and feeling.

    <h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>Long term goals and career pathway:</h2>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to become "financially free" (i.e. retire/not need
        to work) by the time I'm 40, so that I can focus all my time and energy
        on doing what I love - making music, travelling and contributing to
        causes I think are worthwhile. My priority therefore is to find work in
        an industry that pays well (i.e. tech), looks after its employees and
        contributes to a good cause (such as renewable energy), while I develop
        my financial literacy and work towards my personal goals.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>Learning Challenges and Limitations while at Dev Academy:</h2>
      <p>
        Something I've noticed recently is that the particular mental/emotional
        barriers I come up against sometimes have a message. They vary slightly
        each time, but it tends to be some variant of "I can't do this" or "it
        can't be done" or "I don't wanna" or "that isn't fair". I intend to make
        them the subject of reflection and therapeutic exploration as I progress
        through this course, as some will be coming from deeply routed beliefs
        from childhood that I want to challenge and change.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also been experiencing "brain fog" that intensifies my
        susceptibility to being distracted. This is something I will continue
        monitoring and if it becomes a serious issue I will seek professional
        help with. It's also fairly likely I have some kind of undiagnosed ADHD
        that affects my ability to focus, however I suspect my options to
        address this are limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some things that help me to overcome these challenges and limitations
        include: daily sunlight and exercise in the morning, a healthy-enough
        diet, meditation, and staying connected with friends and family. Even
        when all else fails, necessity due to external pressure (e.g. a
        deadline) tends to invoke in me enough sheer force of will to get the
        job done.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>Learning Strengths:</h2>
      <p>
        Being courageously and compassionately honest with myself; my ability to
        remember something (convert to muscle-memory) after I've done it once or
        twice; celebrating my wins - I'm fairly good at remembering to do that
        (although it does take conscious effort sometimes); and analytical
        problem-solving skills and my attention to detail.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>
        What "Human Skills" I would like to see developed while at Dev Academy:
      </h2>

      <ul>
        <li>My ability to focus (and stay focused) on one thing at a time.</li>
        <li>Developing methodologies for mental clarity.</li>
        <li>Actively converting words to images or analogy in my head.</li>
        <li>Improving my confidence with speaking in group environments.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme:</h2>
      <p>
        I will take one day at a time, maintaining the following routine: wake
        up by 8am, exercise, start working by 10am, stick to the Time Boxes and
        use Pomodoro's as much as feasible, have 1-2 breaks for lunch and
        afternoon tea, and finish the day's work by 6pm.
      </p>

      <p>
        When working with team members, facilitators and industry/community
        representatives, I will act according to the Dev Academy principles
        (Integrity, Kindness and Effort), maintaining a clear line of
        communication on group projects using the most appropriate channels, and
        giving feedback using the ASK method (Actionable, Specific and Kind).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>
        What I will do when things are building up and starting to get to me:
      </h2>
      <p>
        I will take a break (go for a walk, do some yoga and/or focus on
        something relaxing for a while) if it is reasonable/feasible. Otherwise,
        I will ask for help from one of my facilitators and/or team members.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>
        A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way:
      </h2>
      <p>
        In Foundations, if I am stuck on something for more than the length of
        12x Pomodoro's (i.e. 1 hour), I will ask for help using the most
        appropriate channel on Discord (or in person, if possible). In Bootcamp,
        I will follow the same rule, except asking for help after 1x Pomodoro.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>What I expect from the Facilitation team:</h2>
      <p>
        I expect the facilitators to uphold the Dev Academy Principles
        (Integrity, Kindness and Effort), and to generally point me in the right
        direction rather than giving me the answers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>Non-EDA Schedule Commitments:</h2>
      <p>
        Every second Wednesday evening (from 6pm till 9pm) I will be attending a
        Men's Group circle, and won't be contactable by phone, email, Discord,
        Slack, carrier pigeon, smoke signal, or screaming my name into the
        ether.
