        Long term goals and career pathway:
      </h2>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to become "financially free" (i.e. retire/not need to work) by the time I'm 40, 
        so that I can focus all my time and energy on doing what I love - making music, travelling and 
        contributing to causes I think are worthwhile. My priority therefore is to find work in an industry 
        that pays well (i.e. tech), looks after its employees and contributes to a good cause (such as 
        renewable energy), while I develop my financial literacy and work towards my personal goals.

Learning Challenges and Limitations while at Dev Academy:
      </h2>
      <p>
        Something I've noticed recently is that the particular mental/emotional barriers I come up against sometimes have a message. They vary slightly each time, but it tends to be some variant of "I can't do this" or "it can't be done" or "I don't wanna" or "that isn't fair". I intend to make them the subject of reflection and therapeutic exploration as I progress through this course, as some will be coming from deeply routed beliefs from childhood that I want to challenge and change.

      </p>
      <p>
        I have also been experiencing "brain fog" that intensifies my susceptibility to being distracted. This is something I will continue monitoring and if it becomes a serious issue I will seek professional help with. It's also fairly likely I have some kind of undiagnosed ADHD that affects my ability to focus, however I suspect my options to address this are limited. 

      </p>
      <p>
        Some things that help me to overcome these challenges and limitations include: daily sunlight and exercise in the morning, a healthy-enough diet, meditation, and staying connected with friends and family. Even when all else fails, necessity due to external pressure (e.g. a deadline) tends to invoke in me enough sheer force of will to get the job done.

    	Celebrating my wins - I'm fairly good at remembering to do that (although it does take conscious effort sometimes).

  </li>

      <h2>
A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme:
      </h2>
      <p>
I will take one day at a time, maintaining the following routine: wake up by 8am, exercise, start working by 10am, stick to the Time Boxes and use Pomodoro's as much as feasible, have 1-2 breaks for lunch and afternoon tea, and finish the day's work by 6pm. 

      </p>

      <p>
When working with team members, facilitators and industry/community representatives, I will act according to the Dev Academy principles (Integrity, Kindness and Effort), maintaining a clear line of communication on group projects using the most appropriate channels, and giving feedback using the ASK method (Actionable, Specific and Kind).

      </p>
    </div>



        <div>
      <h2>
What I will do when things are building up and starting to get to me:
      </h2>
      <p>
      I will take a break (go for a walk, do some yoga and/or focus on something relaxing for a while) if it is reasonable/feasible. Otherwise, I will ask for help from one of my facilitators and/or team members.
	

      </p>
    </div>



        <div>
      <h2>
A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way:
      </h2>
      <p>
In Foundations, if I am stuck on something for more than the length of 12x Pomodoro's (i.e. 1 hour), I will ask for help using the most appropriate channel on Discord (or in person, if possible). In Bootcamp, I will follow the same rule, except asking for help after 1x Pomodoro. 

      </p>
    </div>
        <div>
      <h2>
What I expect from the Facilitation team:
      </h2>
      <p>
       I expect the facilitators to uphold the Dev Academy Principles (Integrity, Kindness and Effort), and to generally point me in the right direction rather than giving me the answers.

      </p>
    </div>



        <div>
      <h2>
Non-EDA Schedule Commitments:
      </h2>
      <p>
  Every second Wednesday evening (from 6pm till 9pm) I will be attending a Men's Group circle, and won't be contactable by phone, email, Discord, Slack, carrier pigeon, smoke signal, or screaming my name into the ether.
