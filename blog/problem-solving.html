    <h1>An Exploration of Problem Solving Techniques</h1>

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>A time when I was blocked on a simple problem...</h2>
      <p>
        I struggled quite a bit with the "Gradebook" and "Built-in Methods" Kata
        exercises. I was using pseudocode a lot to explain to myself the logical
        steps to solve the problems, but my code kept not working despite being
        logically sound (at least in my head). The issue was that I didn't know
        what I didn't know about syntax and JavaScript methods, so I couldn't
        easily break down what the problem was. Console.log() sometimes helped
        here to tell me when I had done correctly halfway through my code, but I
        couldn't always get that to work. I felt frustrated during the process
        and ultimately resorted to ChatGPT to answer the problem and break down
        the steps so I could understand where I went wrong. If I learned
        anything from this process it's that ChatGPT is quite reliable but isn't
        nearly as satisfying as solving a problem without it.
      </p>

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>A time when I elegantly solved a problem...</h2>
      <p>
        Somehow I did everything in the JavaScript Olympics in just over half an
        hour, mostly getting everything right first time without needing to
        Google anything. I found JS much easier after doing the rest of the Kata
        exercises; all I needed to do was jump in and "try something", using the
        error messages in the npm test to adjust, and my previous answers to the
        other exercises to remind me of syntax/methods.

        Reflecting on how confident I feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes:

      <!--The following list formatting was created using ChatGPT - I pasted in
      the list from the Dev handbook and asked it to recreate it in HTML list 
      format with empty sub list item for each one for my answers. The answers are my own -->

        <li>
          Pseudocode
          <ul>
            <li>
              Reasonably confident. I found it a little tricky to get my head
              around at first - mainly because I am not yet very familiar with
              what JavaScript can and can't do. But with practice it is becoming
              one of the best ways to mitigate my tendency to multi-task and
              instead focus on one thing at a time.

          Trying something:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Very. Jumping in and working by trial-and-error is my go-to
              methodology.

        <li>
          Rubber ducky method:
          <ul>
            <li>
              So far I have been getting by without strictly using this method,
              but I often think of the concept generally when writing pseudocode
              to break down a confusing problem to its understandable
              components.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Reading error messages:
          <ul>
            <li>
              It depends on the error message. Usually I can find the relevant
              piece of information within error messages in Terminal etc., but
              sometimes it needs a Google for me to understand it.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Console.logging:
          <ul>
            <li>
              I understand the usefulness of this and am reasonably confident
              with applying it, but I haven't been using it very much (it
              stopped working for me in terminal halfway through the Kata
              exercises, still not sure why)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Googling:
          <ul>
            <li>10000%</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Asking your peers for help:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Stranger danger! I do feel a reluctance to asking for help from my
              peers generally. Although being stuck and frustrated on a problem
              for more than 1x Pomodoro is usually enough to offset any
              embarrassment I might feel.

        <li>
          Asking coaches for help:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Similar story as above. Sometimes it takes a lot for me to admit I
              need help, but when it comes to it I'm generally good at reminding
              myself it's totally fine and normal to not be a superhuman coding
              machine by week 4 of a web development course. I feel slightly
              less resistance to asking a coach (who I'm paying to be there when
              I need help) than asking my peers.

          Improving your process with reflection:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Reflection is something that I think helps with retention of new
              ideas and getting familiar with new processes, but I haven't
              noticeably found it directly useful for problem solving.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>Reflecting on a time I was reluctant to ask for help.</h2>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, I sometimes find it embarrassing to admit that I
        need help. One example of this is in the recent JavaScript Kata
        exercises: I would frequently come up with the correct logical solution
        but the code wouldn't work due to incorrect syntax. I would use all my
        other problem solving methods before asking for help.
      </p>
      <p>
        This reluctance is probably due to my social conditioning of needing to
        "fit in" and/or be seen as smart/cool/etc. by my peers. No one else was
        asking for help on these exercises in Discord and I didn't want to be
        the first, even though if I think about it, it might have been helpful
        for other people to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing I could try next time I am struggling on something is to
        remind myself of the opportunity this could provide other people to
        learn-by-teaching, and see if anyone in my team can see the issue with
        my code.
