        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          When there are distractions around, unless I strongly believe in and
          feel connected to the reason I'm doing a task, I will usually want to
          do the bare minimum.
        </li>
        <li>
          My ability to focus my attention on any given day is very
          inconsistent. I will need to make good sleep, exercise and a good diet
          a priority in bootcamp, and create or go to a distraction-free
          environment whenever possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          I am at a point in my life where my negative beliefs/messages/thoughts
          are on average just as loud and hold just as much sway as my positive
          beliefs/messages/thoughts, and I need to remember to take my health
          seriously, and myself not-too-seriously. hjfgkdslhfdsa.
