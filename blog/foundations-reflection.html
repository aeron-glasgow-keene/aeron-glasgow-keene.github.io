      <h2>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          When there are distractions around, unless I strongly believe in and
          feel connected to the reason I'm doing a task, I will usually want to
          do the bare minimum.
        </li>
        <li>
          My ability to focus my attention on any given day is very
          inconsistent. I will need to make good sleep, exercise and a good diet
          a priority in bootcamp, and create or go to a distraction-free
          environment whenever possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          I am at a point in my life where my negative beliefs/messages/thoughts
          are on average just as loud and can hold just as much sway as my
          positive beliefs/messages/thoughts, and I need to remember to take my
          health seriously, and myself not-too-seriously. hjfgkdslhfdsa.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        They are all crucial for being a decent and functioning person, in
        general in my view. Your values will determine where your energy for
        doing a task comes from, and how in alignment with your values you feel
        you are impacts your self-esteem/self-image. The healthier your
        self-esteem/self-image, the easier it will be to learn new skills and
        take on new challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reserves of positive energy and self-belief are necessary for
        cultivating the patience to learn programming - that most finicky of
        skills. Code never lies to you. It's like a good FromSoft boss - if it's
        just not happening, despite your confidence that it would, it's you that
        messed up.

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h2>
      <p>
        How familiar I was with the concepts already, and yet how reticent I was
        to doing the exercises. Also how pumped I was to get a solid routine and
        then how lazy I was with implementing it / how unimportant it seemed a
        couple weeks later.

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>
        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Deciding on what to write in the reflection exercises, knowing they'd be
        seen by god knows who. Particularly in regards to my identity, strengths
        and values.

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Bootcamp programme can be very intense, and it is helpful for this
        reason alone to provide guidance in looking after our emotional and
        mental wellbeing. However it also makes a lot of sense that if the focus
        is on creating highly employable graduates, to therefore be teaching us
        how to develop our people skills. Employers are looking for good fits to
        their team, not people who have the technical skills but no people
        skills.

    <div class="paragraph-box">
      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
        waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
        programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Despite my answer to the previous question, when doing the exercises it
        did sometimes feel like a waste of my time. Sometimes I told myself I
        was good enough / familiar enough already at active listening etc., but
        the things I have to remember are a) I am predisposed (culturally or
        otherwise) to thinking that working on myself isn't worth the effort,
        and b) Human Skills need regular practice, like any other skill, to be
        proficient at it.
