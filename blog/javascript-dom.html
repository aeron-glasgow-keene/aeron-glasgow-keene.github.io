    <h1>JavaScript and the DOM</h1>

    <div>
      <h2>
        An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and
        CSS...
      </h2>
      <p>
        If Frodo and his hobbit bros could only destroy the Ring through snazzy
        web development, then they will need some help from some very special
        fellows. HTML is the Aragorn of the group - he is the badass leader and
        rock that keeps everyone in line. CSS is obviously Legolas, who is
        mostly there just to provide flair and eye candy. JavaScript is the bro
        Gandalf, the buzzy spiritual guide, sometimes he's there, sometimes he's
        not, but knows the most things and has the most insight to the greater
        will of the internet. Also, if you were wondering, Gollum is cookies,
        Gimli is pop up ads/messages and Sauron is probably Mark Zuckerburg,
        idk.
