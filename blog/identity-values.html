        I recently found a mouse up at the land where my Mum and stepdad live.
        They live in the foothills of the Tararuas, where rodents are a real
        threat to native flora and fauna. It didn't scamper away as I
        approached, and I was able to scoop it up into my hands. I then realised
        I was in a situation conflicting to me as an animal lover. I brought it
        to my stepdad, as I was unsure what the best thing would be to do with
        it - or rather, I knew but didn't want to do it myself. I guess I was
        hoping he'd agree with my idea to put it in a box and release it down in
        the suburbs where they theoretically don't pose as much of a threat to
        nature. Once he pointed out that it was likely poisoned (hence not
        running at my approach), the best thing to do became clear. I couldn't
        reconcile the conflict in my values as quickly as he could, so I gave it
        to him and he drowned it in a watering can. I remember looking into its
        eyes before handing it over... I draw some solace in the fact we were
        likely ending its suffering, and that I showed it some measure of
        compassion, before doing what was best for the greater good. Reflecting
        on it now, I can see that acting compassionately and acting logically
        are both core values of mine, though the latter (usually) comes out on
        top in a conflict.

        My identity and values are absolutely a product of the people around me
        during my life. I am fortunate to have been raised by parents who were
        both kind-hearted, artistic and relatively introverted people, and
        there's no doubting that I assimilated a lot of they way they thought
        about themselves and the world at large.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back, I can also see that my peers (and/or, the need to fit in)
        also did a lot of the work of molding my identity. I wasn't actively
        into the arts, despite having the propensity for it, until my high
        school friends effectively peer-pressured me into pretending that I
        loved rock and emo music and had the same taste as themâ€¦ But in the
        process, I started to legitimately enjoy it, and ended up becoming more
        obsessed with becoming a musician than everyone else around me. For most
        of the rest of my life since then I believed being a musician was the
        only viable career path for me (reality has since insisted otherwise,
        resulting in the ongoing identity crisis I am currently in).
      </p>
      <p>
        Another crucial element to the forming of my values/identity has been
        stumbling into the world of men's groups. Describing my journey with
        this would involve divulging more personal details than I am willing to
        share on the internet, but my involvement with and support from
        communities dedicated to fostering healthy, human connection, healing
        and growth has been fundamental to keeping my sanity as a highly
        empathetic person in the insane world we live in.
      </p>

        I have also recently explored the Burning Man community culture and
        values. I'm still working out what I do and don't like about it, but I
        definitely appreciate the idea of mindful/responsible hedonism, which is
        a key part of my journey in what you might call identity reforming. As
        are my recent travel experiences in Europe, further solidifying my
        want/need for adventure and novelty in my life right now.

        My greatest strengths include: being radically honest and compassionate
        with myself, backing myself. Practicing mindfulness and courageousness.
        My eye for detail, critical thinking and the tenacity I have when I am
        passionate about something. I don't yet know the full extent of the
        course outline, but I suspect these will all be crucial to making it
        through Dev Academy in one piece - with the way I handle workload,
        manage my own emotional/mental health, and collaborate with others.

        I sometimes have difficulty with focusing - I find myself feeling
        scatterbrained and easily distracted, especially when I multi-task. I
        can mitigate this by looking after myself in all the usual boring ways
        (getting enough sleep, exercise etc.), mindfulness meditation, yoga,
        staying in touch with people I can have honest and meaningful
        conversations with.

        My bandmate and I clashed ideologically and creativity quite a bit
        during my time as a performing artist. Our personalities clashed and we
        pushed each other's buttons at band practice. For the most part, my
        strategy was to either find ways to productively communicate my issues,
        or to hold in the frustration until I knew how to communicate it
        cleanly. Sometimes that worked, but mostly what ended up happening was
        that I would hold it in until I burst out in an unhelpful
        comment/expression of frustration, which would force us into talking
        about it. Fortunately we were both good at talking about it once
        feelings were expressed and we had calmed down. In a sense this was
        effective, as it eventually got both of us on the same page that we
        needed to be. In another sense, it caused needless tension and outbursts
        of emotion that was unconducive to a creative/performance environment,
        and negatively impacted those around us.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days I am much better at recognising what conflicts are going on
        within myself earlier on, and recognising the importance of
        communicating this clearly early on. I do recognise the need to develop
        my "Non-Violent Communication" skills further, and I'm looking forward
        to the opportunities to do that during this course.
