    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

    <div>
      <h> What is Emotional Intelligence? </h>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is a set of skills that enables acting with
        conscious awareness of one's own and other people's emotions and
        predispositions, as well as the impact that one's thoughts, emotions and
        actions has on themselves and the people around them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h> How is EQ different to IQ? </h>
      <p>
        IQ attempts to measure a person's general knowledge, memory skills,
        problem-solving skills, and ability to think both logically and
        critically.
      </p>
      <p>
        EQ pertains to a person's ability to maintain a healthy relationship
        with themselves and the people in their life, by identifying and
        managing emotions within themselves and in others.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h> Why is EQ important?</h>
      <p>
        Without a healthy level of EQ, it will be very difficult to maintain
        healthy, positive relationships with the people in your life, and with
        your relationship to yourself. EQ helps to navigate the stresses of the
        21st Century world in a way that is proactive rather than reactive,
        especially in regards to processing emotions. In the corporate
        environment, someone with a high EQ is more likely to work well as a
        team and as a leader, meaning they are more likely to move up the
        corporate ladder.
