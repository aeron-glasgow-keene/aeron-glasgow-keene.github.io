    <div class="text-box">
      <h2>Margins</h2>
      <p>
        The space between elements (things - anything) on a page. Margins are a
        bit special - they're not like all the other girls. Margins like to
        share space with eachother because they are socialist hippies. And like
        socialist hippies, they are harder to control than borders or padding.
        The thing to remember is that when you want to increase the space
        between your elements, only the biggest margin value between the
        elements will apply.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
      <h2>Borders</h2>
      <p>
        Borders are pretty self explanatory. They are technically always there
        even if you can't see them. But say for example that you are a fascist
        orange and are worried about immigrants stealing your wigs and
        extra-orange spray tan. You can use these parameters to make the borders
        visible and more imposing.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
      <h2>Padding</h2>
      <p>
        Padding is for when the content inside your element is extra sensitive
        to the troubles of the world and needs a bit more space.
